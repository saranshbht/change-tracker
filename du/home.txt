New Year Message from the Vice Chancellor (acting)
As we stand at the doorstep to bid the year 2020 goodbye and receive the new year 2021, let us first of all thank God that we are alive to be in this moment and pray for our colleagues and their near and dear ones whom we lost this year to the pandemic. The year 2020 has been a challenging year for all of us, but challenges also brought along opportunities to experience, learn and bring out the best in us.
The University has shown its resilience and ability to adapt and convert a challenging situation to an opportunity. Traditional classrooms, where teaching and learning transacted, have been completely replaced by online platforms, overcoming the barriers of space. Students are able to write their examinations within the comforts of their home/space and teachers are able to evaluate through electronic means. To expand its landscape of e-learning and teaching, the University launched One-DU portal. It has enhanced accessibility to learning, fosters best practices, and promotes professional development, by harnessing the benefits of available educational technologies.
Indeed, everyone has made an effort to keep the system in motion in spite of the difficulties. Earnest efforts have been made to speed up important tasks and make up for the time lost during the lockdown period, which includes taking up and completing pending recruitments and promotions. The result of the collective efforts put now shall be seen in the coming year.
It gives me immense pleasure to remind you all that the University shall be entering its 100 th year in 2021. The Centennial Celebration remind us not only of the legacy that has been handed down to us through the hard work and sweat of our predecessors, but also our responsibility to hold the torch high for the ideals that the University has stood for. It is indeed the collective responsibility of each one of us to give our best in whatever we do, instead of compromising with mediocracy, so that we continue to be an ‘Institute of Eminence’ not just today but for times to come.
Wish you all and your family a happy, prosperous, safe and healthy year 2021.
