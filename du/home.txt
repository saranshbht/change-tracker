Constitution Day (26 November 2020)
Message from the Vice Chancellor (acting) to Students.
Dear Students,
I extend a warm welcome to the fresh batch of young scholars who have made it to India’s best known University. This batch will be the special one to become the part of the centenary celebrations of Delhi University, which is turning 100 in a few months.
I am very happy that most of you have patiently completed the online admission process to connect yourself to the university’s firm devotion to truth - Nishta, Dhriti, Satyam. I am so excited to see the best and the brightest of India’s youngest student pool becoming the part of DU.
I think none of us will have lived through a crisis like this and there are now fundamental changes to our daily lives, the way we study, communicate, work and socialise. The present crisis may change us in multiple ways and there could be institutional challenges on a scale we have never known, but there will always be innovations and fresh ideas which bring assuring gains in the future.
Though normal academic activities have suffered owing to the Covid-19 situation, we tried our best not to obstruct our pursuit of teaching and research. The pandemic has forced us to rethink the way we have been working. Our fellow colleagues have successfully adapted to new innovative digital aids to ensure quality teaching and learning process. My colleagues have been incredibly creative to formulate and adapt education and work to a new format. I strongly encourage you to connect using the many technology options made available to you. I am also aware that many of us are struggling due to technological challenges specially who are in the remote areas of the country. This will require us to make significant changes in the ways in which we operate, so as to become much more flexible in how we teach, research and administer the university.
So, despite all odds, I am very confident that the things that have made Delhi University prosper will remain key strengths in the future. Please remember, nothing is more important than the health, well-being and safety of the DU community. Please take care of yourself, your family and loved ones during this stressful time. Best wishes
Professor P.C. Joshi
